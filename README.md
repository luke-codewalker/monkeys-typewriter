# Monkeys With Typewriters ‚å®üêí

This [page](https://luke-codewalker.github.io/monkeys-typewriter/) demonstrates a genetic algorithm that will evolve a population of monkeys with typewriters to type a given target phrase. You can play around with the target phrase, the population size and the mutation rate and see how it affects the evolution process. 

* See [below](#genetic-algorithm) to learn more about the implementation on his page
* This creation was inspired by [Daniel Shiffmann](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) and his Nature of Code video series, especially [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrKjSeoc7fc)
